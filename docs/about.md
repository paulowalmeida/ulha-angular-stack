# Ulha Angular Stack
### **You no longer need to build your Angular applications from scratch.** 

From this stack you can create angular applications in several versions without the need to install **@angular/cli**.

In addition, there is the possibility of starting with a **standard angular template** or try **our template**, which merges **clean architecture concepts** and great **design standards** into your architecture.

In addition to templates, you have several plugins that will help you with productivity, such as: Create a service that communicates with an api or deliver a state management module using ngrx/store.

If you want to use a template with a plugin together, we also offer stackfiles.
