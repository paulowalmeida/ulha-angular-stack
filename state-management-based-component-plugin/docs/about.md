# **State Management Based Component Plugin**

The State Management Based Component Plugin iis an aggregate of technologies and architectural concepts and design patterns that make it easy to create a component that uses state management and API communication under the hood.

This plugin supports being installed in both angular projects created from the stack and by the conventional method.

Next you see more details about the plugin.

## **Plugin core technologies**

The purpose of this session is to inform which technologies are part of the Java Spring AWS SNS Plugin.

By applying this plugin in a Java Spring Boot project, your application can benefit from the entire Amazon SNS infrastructure to handle notifications in your application.

### **Technological Composition**

The definition of this Plugin was designed to facilitate the use of Amazon SNS as a Publisher and Subscribe for messaging Java applications.

We understand that quality is non-negotiable, and we look to technologies and methodologies as a means to obtain the much-desired software quality. This premise was the guide for choosing each technology detailed below.


- Production environment
    - Spring Cloud AWS Messaging
    - Amazon SDK SQS
- Test environment
    - Spring Clud AWS Test
    - Awaitility
    - JUnit
    - Test Containers
        - LocalStack
- Development environment
    - Docker Compose
        - LocalStack Container


## **What are the capabilities Enabled**

By applying the Java Spring AWS SNS Plugin to your Java Spring Boot project, your project will be able to:

1. Create SNS Publishers
2. Configure SNS subscribes
3. Create Topics in SNS
4. Design and build software components that use Amazon SNS without connecting to AWS.
5. Create an automated integration test suite with TestContainers and LocalStack
7. Create Tests of an asynchronous nature for Subscribers with Awaitility
8. Development environment set up next to Docker with Docker-compose.
9. LocalStack for testing and local development

## **What are the benefits of using Java Spring AWS SNS Plugin**

1. Ease of configuring and using Amazon SNS in your project through the StackSpot CLI.
2. Publisher for Amazon SNS example codes using best practices.
3. Sample codes on how to Subscribe to Amazon SNS using best practices.
4. Integration Tests sample codes to validate Publisher SNS behavior.
5. Integration Test example codes to validate behavior of Subscribers notified by Amazon SNS.
7. Configuration of the test environment with JUnit and Test Containers.
8. DockerCompose for using Amazon SNS with LocalStack in a development environment.
9. Logs enabled to facilitate troubleshooting

## **Applying Java Spring AWS SNS Plugin**

To apply the Java Spring AWS SNS Plugin in your projects and enjoy its benefits, you must have the StackSpot CLI installed on your machine. [If not, follow this tutorial to install](https://docs.stackspot.com/docs/stk-cli/installation/).

### 1. Import the Stack on your machine

```sh
stk import stack https://github.com/zup-academy/java-springboot-restapi-stack
```

### 2. Now check if the Stack was successfully imported

```sh
stk list stack | grep java-springboot
```

### 3. Apply the Plugin, in your project directory, execute

```sh
stk apply plugin java-springboot-restapi-stack/java-spring-aws-sns-plugin
```

### 4. Check the changes in your project

```sh
git status
```
