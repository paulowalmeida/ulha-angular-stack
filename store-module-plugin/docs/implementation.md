## First considerations
When the module is generated, you can explore and observe that there is a **effects.ts** file with some code snippets commenting.
These snippets are exactly for you to adjust your communication **service** to correctly use the effects.

## Experimenting with the component
To use the generated component, you need to follow some steps:

You must include the following lines in the imports of the module that you want to control the store:

```sh
StoreModule.forFeature('<yourFeatureSelector>', yourReducer),
EffectsModule.forFeature([<yourEffects>])
```

Make sure the imports are correct.

And that's it. Now you can use or modify the store to suit your needs.
Hope I can help you with this plugin. ;)
